CertNode Trust Constitution (v1.0)

1. Purpose
CertNode exists to guarantee structural, sovereign, and independently verifiable certification of nonfiction outputs across distributed publishing environments.

2. Authority
The issuing authority for CertNode Core is the runtime operator. All vault nodes must declare issuer identity and conform to the licensing schema.

3. Federation
Nodes may federate under license and must comply with trust consistency and sync integrity requirements.

4. Enforcement
Violations of licensing or protocol rules may result in vault revocation, delisting, or trust invalidation.

5. Permanence
All certified outputs must retain verifiability independent of runtime availability through offline capsule export and ledger inclusion.
